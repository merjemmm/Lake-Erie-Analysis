## Analysis of Lake Erie and the Harmful Algal Blooms
The entire report can be found under the PDF file. 

The purpose of this analysis was to better understand how nutrient levels in the western basin of Lake Erie have changed over time and whether high nutrient levels correlate 
with known Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) events by plotting, cross-examining, and researching physical implications of our data. 
Furthermore, we want to know how agricultural runoff and wastewater discharge affect nutrient conentrations in Lake Erie and if one is more indicative of HABs events. 

Through our analysis, we saw that nutrient levels of nitrate/nitrite and dissolved phosphorus vary seasonally. 
More specifically, nutrients tend to increase in the Summer months (during high temperatures).

Futhermore, nutrient concentrations were seen to have strong positive relationships during significant HAB years, and vice versa (negatively correlated) for mild HAB years. 
One interesting observation of the peaking nutrient data suggest that even when nutrient levels are particularly high, they tend to synchronously peak during significant HAB 
years whereas nutrient peaks occur asynchronously during mild HAB years.
